## About <a name = "about"></a>

I'm storing ugly pictures of heads in a git repository.

## Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions are for design file management.

### Installing

Set up new repository with Git LFS, which is a way to manage large files.

* Set up a new repository
* Follow the steps for setting up Git LFS
```
$ git lfs
$ git lfs install
```
* List out all of the types of files you anticipate you will need to track. Sketch, Illustrator and Photoshop files can be huge. I would also recommend listing any prototyping software files.
```
git lfs track “*.psd”
git lfs track “*.sketch”
git lfs track “*.ai”
```
 Make sure that .gitattributes is tracked
```
git add .gitattributes
```


### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo.

## Usage <a name = "usage"></a>

Add notes about how to use the system.
